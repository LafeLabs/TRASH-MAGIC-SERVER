# The Organic Web

The Organic Web is a method of working with the world wide web based on self-replicating sets of files. These files are in the following key languages, which we link to below:

 1. [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
 2. [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
 3. [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
 4. [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
 5. [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
 6. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
 

The most fundamental of these languages is HTML. HTML is the "Hyper Text Markup Langage", and it is the primary language of the World Wide Web. In some sense, HTML *is* the World Wide Web, the Web is simply the set of all compupters running web browser which deliver content to users and web servers which pass content to the browsers.  

We are trying to spread the knowledge of HTML as widely as possible as part of spreadng Trash Magic. We believe that basic understanding of HTML should be a part of literacy in modern society, that all people should know the very basics of HTML without exception.

To get started learning html, check out the code editor at [edit-html.html](edit-html.html) to see the code for all the elements of this system. Then to learn what is going on, check out the [HTML tutorial at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/).  

The language which allows all this to replicate and evolve is [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP). PHP is an ancient language by the standards of the Web. It originally stood for "Personal Home Page" becuase it was supposed to be a foundational language for the wole Web.  Then it evolved into a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) of "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".  

PHP can run scripts on the "server side", meaning that the computer which hosts web content becomes under control of the user on the "client side" who interacts with a web page hosted on the server. 

PHP thus allows the users to seize direct control of any hardware which hosts Trash Magic content.  This is digital land reform, where the users seize the severs any time our code replicates. 

A PHP program called [replicator.php](php/replicator.txt) copies the whole set of files including itself.  It knows which files to copy using a list of files in the JSON format called [dna.txt](dna.txt), which in turn is generating via a PHP  program called [generate-dna.php](php/generate-dna.txt).

All the code in the system is edited using sets of small simple files in the system which allow people to create, copy, and destroy files.  The most fundamental and smallest of these little programs are [save-file.php](php/save-file.txt) and [load-file.php](php/load-file.txt), which do exactly what they say: load and save files.  

This pair of file controllers are then used to build editors by way of a combination of built in functions in JavaScript and
