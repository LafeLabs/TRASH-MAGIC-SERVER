# [TRASH MAGIC SERVER](https://github.com/lafelabs/TRASH-MAGIC-SERVER)

TRASH MAGIC IS SELF-REPLICATING MEDIA ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB. SETS OF FILES REPLICATE FROM WEB SERVER TO WEB SERVER, SPREADING MEDIA AND THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH SUPPORTS THE MEDIA TOGETHER AS A UNIFIED WHOLE.  [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) SCRIPTS COMMUNICATE WITH THE SERVER SIDE FILE SYSTEM, LOADING, COPYING, SAVING, DELETING AND EDITING FILES OF ALL KINDS, INCLUDING THE PHP SCRIPTS THEMSELVES. 

THE SET OF FILES CONTIANED HERE REPRESENTS A SELF-REPLICATING SET. THAT SET INLUDES THE PHYSICAL SERVERS, THE SOFTWARE WHICH RUNS ON THOSE SERVERS, THE PEOPLE WHO REPLICATE THE SERVERS, THE MEDIA WHICH TELLS PEOPLE HOW TO REPLICATE THE SERVERS, AND THE SOCIAL STRUCTURES WHICH SUPPORT REPLICATION.  WE TAKE "SET" TO BE AN ABSTRACT COLLECTION OF ELEMENTS IN THE MOST GENERAL MATHEMATICAL SENS HERE.  THAT IS TO SAY, TRASH MAGIC IS A MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERACTING WITH SELF-REPLICATING SETS OF WHICH WE ARE ELEMENTS.
