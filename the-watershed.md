# The Trash Magic Watershed Network

 - rivers
 - oceans
 - streams
 - creeks
 - canals
 - storm sewers
 - sanitary sewers
 - aquaducts
 - ground water flow
 - cloud networks
 - atmospheric rivers

We build media along all these waterways, and we build up network infrastructure that represents this network.  We build mesh networks with web servers and power generation stations along all rivers in the world using waste stream sourced hardware.  

We start with major nodes such as where rivers flow together or cross major streets, starting by building social and media networks in those nodes and then branching out as we grow to fully cover all waterways with a continously connected fully liberated network.  

Flowing water and air can both be used to generate power along waterways. Servers also take data on the water and on the living systems in the water and share those data sets along the networkf freely.
