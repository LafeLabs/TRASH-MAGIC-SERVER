## GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE

THE GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE IS A CARDBOARD CUBE 4 INCHES ON A SIDE MADE UP OF CUT PIECES OF CARDBOARD INTO SHAPES THAT FIT TOGETHER LIKE PUZZLE PIECES!

TO BUILD A NETWORK OF HYPERCBES WE START WITH 4 INCH SQUARES, CONVERTING A FLOW OF CARDBOARD TRASH INTO THESE 4 INCH SQUARES!

ALL THESE SQUARES CAN HAVE LINKS TO WEB RESOURCES!

THIS MAKES ALL THE SQUARES INTO HYPERTEXT!

THEY ARE LINKS TO WEB RESOURCES, WHICH IN TURN LINK BACK TO THE PHYSICAL THINGS AND THE PHYSICAL SPACES THEY EXIST IN!

CARDBOARD CUBES ARE USED TO CARRY 3 X 5 INCH CARDBOARD CARDS WHICH ARE ALSO PHYSICAL HYPERTEXT!
