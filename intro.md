# What Is Trash Magic?

## Trash Magic Is a Web Framework

Trash magic is a method of creating documents in the world wide web where all control is on the client side of the browser.  This consists of a set of files in the languages of the web which all replicate themselves from the client side of the browser and also are edited live in the browser.

## Trash Magic is a Law

The Law of Trash is this: Everything free for everyone everywhere right now!  We build a system of free media on which a whole economy of free things can be distributed.

## Trash Magic is a Philosophy

Trash Magic is a philosophy which states that we as a civilization should build everything we need for a good life from trash and what we can grown in our local soil ecosystem.  We aim to build this via self-replicating media built entirely from trash which replicates all the other technology built from trash.  

## Trash Magic is a JavaScript Library

### [trashmagic.js](trashmagic.js)

The rainbow text in this document is created with the Trash Magic JavasScript library, which also has a function for generating arbitrary rainbow elements of any kind in a web browser and also injecting sets of randomly distrubted googley eyes in a web browser.


## Trash Magic is a Way of Life

Trash Magicians are the people who follow trash magic as a way of life.  We learn the whole system of technology well enough to teach other people.  We aim to spread the magic, and that is what makes it magic: replication.   The people who teach other people how to replicate all the elements of Trash Magic are Trash Magicians.

## Trash Magic is An Operating System

The set of files which make up Trash Magic effectively form an [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) which we use entirely from the client side of the web browser.  We can build a whole civilizaion this way, with almost no direct command line interaction with the host OS on which the server software runs.  As long as we can get [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) to work, the whole system works.

## Trash Magic is a book

This book, the [Trash Magic Book](read-markdown-file.php?filename=book.md).  This is both an ebook and a system for making ebooks. It is also a physical book which we print out from this online book and then illstrate and distribute along the physical networks.  This is a self-replicating book.  It contains the means to relicate itself as well as to replicate all the technology it documents and which hosts it and which it was written on.  This is a living book, it is organic media which is co-created by the readers and writers in the trash magic network. 

## Trash Magic is a Reality

In Trash Magic we believe that we live in a society which forms a network on two physical layers: the Street and the Watershed.
