# What Is Trash Magic?

## Trash Magic Is a Web Framework

Trash magic is a method of creating documents in the world wide web where all control is on the client side of the browser.  This consists of a set of files in the languages of the web which all replicate themselves from the client side of the browser and also are edited live in the browser.

## Trash Magic is a Law

The Law of Trash is this: Everything free for everyone everywhere right now!  We build a system of free media on which a whole economy of free things can be distributed.

## Trash Magic is a Philosophy

Trash Magic is a philosophy which states that we as a civilization should build everything we need for a good life from trash and what we can grown in our local soil ecosystem.  We aim to build this via self-replicating media built entirely from trash which replicates all the other technology built from trash.  

## Trash Magic is a JavaScript Library

### [trashmagic.js](trashmagic.js)

The rainbow text in this document is created with the Trash Magic JavasScript library, which also has a function for generating arbitrary rainbow elements of any kind in a web browser and also injecting sets of randomly distrubted googley eyes in a web browser.


## Trash Magic is a Way of Life

Trash Magicians are the people who follow trash magic as a way of life.  We learn the whole system of technology well enough to teach other people.  We aim to spread the magic, and that is what makes it magic: replication.   The people who teach other people how to replicate all the elements of Trash Magic are Trash Magicians.

## Trash Magic is An Operating System

The set of files which make up Trash Magic effectively form an [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) which we use entirely from the client side of the web browser.  We can build a whole civilizaion this way, with almost no direct command line interaction with the host OS on which the server software runs.  As long as we can get [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) to work, the whole system works.
